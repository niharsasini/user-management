Proof of Concept (POC) Document
Project Overview
This Proof of Concept (POC) aims to create a basic user management system for freshers in the company to understand and implement fundamental authentication and CRUD operations. The application will be built using React (or Angular) for the frontend, Node.js (or Python/Java/.NET) for the backend, and MySQL for the database.

Features
1.	Authentication System
○	Login
○	Signup
○	Forgot Password
○	Update Password
2.	User Management
○	Add User (Fields: Name, DOB, Password, Profile Image)
○	Edit User
○	Delete User
○	List Users (with Search & Sort functionality for all fields)
